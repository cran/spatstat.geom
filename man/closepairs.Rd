\arguments{
  \item{X,Y}{
    Point patterns (objects of class \code{"ppp"}).
  }
  \item{rmax}{
    Maximum distance between pairs of points to be counted as close pairs.
  }
  \item{twice}{
    Logical value indicating whether all ordered pairs of close points
    should be returned. If \code{twice=TRUE} (the default),
    each pair will appear twice in the output, as \code{(i,j)}
    and again as \code{(j,i)}. If \code{twice=FALSE},
    then each pair will appear only once, as the pair \code{(i,j)}
    with \code{i < j}.
  }
  \item{what}{
    String specifying the data to be returned for each close pair of points.
    If \code{what="all"} (the default) then the
    returned information includes the indices \code{i,j} of each pair,
    their \code{x,y} coordinates, and the distance between them.
    If \code{what="indices"} then only the indices \code{i,j} are
    returned.
    If \code{what="ijd"} then the indices \code{i,j} and the
    distance \code{d} are returned.
  }
  \item{distinct}{
    Logical value indicating whether to return only the
    pairs of points with different indices \code{i} and \code{j}
    (\code{distinct=TRUE}, the default) or to also include
    the pairs where \code{i=j} (\code{distinct=FALSE}).
  }
  \item{neat}{
    Logical value indicating whether to ensure that \code{i < j}
    in each output pair, when \code{twice=FALSE}. 
  }
  \item{periodic}{
    Logical value indicating whether to use the periodic edge correction.
    The window of \code{X} should be a rectangle.
    Opposite pairs of edges of the window will be treated as identical.
  }
  \item{\dots}{Extra arguments, ignored by methods.}
  \item{iX,iY}{
    Optional vectors used to determine whether a point in \code{X}
    is identical to a point in \code{Y}. See Details.
  }
}
\details{
  These are the efficient low-level functions used by \pkg{spatstat}
  to find all close pairs of points in a point pattern
  or all close pairs between two point patterns. 

  \code{closepairs(X,rmax)} finds all pairs of distinct points
  in the pattern \code{X} which lie at a distance less than or equal to
  \code{rmax} apart, and returns them. The result is
  a list with the following components:
  \describe{
    \item{i}{Integer vector of indices of the first point in each pair.}
    \item{j}{Integer vector of indices of the second point in each pair.}
    \item{xi,yi}{Coordinates of the first point in each pair.}
    \item{xj,yj}{Coordinates of the second point in each pair.}
    \item{dx}{Equal to \code{xj-xi}}
    \item{dy}{Equal to \code{yj-yi}}
    \item{d}{Euclidean distance between each pair of points.}
  }
  If \code{what="indices"} then only the components \code{i} and
  \code{j} are returned. This is slightly faster and more efficient
  with use of memory.

  \code{crosspairs(X,rmax)} identifies all pairs of neighbours
  \code{(X[i], Y[j])} between the patterns \code{X} and \code{Y},
  and returns them. The result is
  a list with the same format as for \code{closepairs}.
  
  The arguments \code{iX} and \code{iY} are used when
  the two point patterns \code{X} and \code{Y} may have some points in
  common.  In this situation \code{crosspairs(X, Y)} would return some
  pairs of points in which the two points are identical.
  To avoid this, attach a unique integer
  identifier to each point, such that two points are identical if their
  identifier values are equal. Let \code{iX} be the vector of
  identifier values for the points in \code{X}, and \code{iY}
  the vector of identifiers for points in \code{Y}. Then the code
  will only compare two points if they have different values of the
  identifier.

\section{Warning about accuracy}{
  The results of these functions may not agree exactly with
  the correct answer (as calculated by a human) and may not
  be consistent between different computers and different installations
  of \R. The discrepancies arise in marginal cases where the interpoint
  distance is equal to, or very close to, the threshold \code{rmax}.

  Floating-point numbers in a computer
  are not mathematical Real Numbers: they are approximations using
  finite-precision binary arithmetic.
  The approximation is accurate to a tolerance of about
  \code{.Machine$double.eps}.

  If the true interpoint distance \eqn{d} and the threshold \code{rmax}
  are equal, or if their difference is no more than \code{.Machine$double.eps},
  the result may be incorrect.
